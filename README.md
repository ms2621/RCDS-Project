# Prediction of Promoter Strength with Machine Learning (Random Forest Model)

## Quick Intro
We are Interdisciplinary Computing Project Group 4 from the Imperial College I-Explore course. The aim of our project is to use a Random Forest model to predict promoter strength in DNA. This is an interdisciplinary project that bridges the fields of biochemistry and computing. Our team consists of four members who are second-year biochemists and physicists at Imperial College London.
